# Definitions 

**Partner Status** <br />
Pionero Philanthropy categorizes nonprofit organizations in the Republic of Guatemala by Partnership Status. It is our goal to form… <

- Partner: A ‘Partner’ is a nonprofit organization that has met the basic initial parameters for eligibility, has met the parameters for partnership, has gone through the evaluation of Pionero, and has been vetted as a noteworthy organization in the Republic of Guatemala based on Pionero’s 5 Pillars: Efficiency, Transparency, Impact, Relevance, and Sustainability. 

- Discontinued Partner: A ‘Discontinued Partner’ is a nonprofit organization that met the basic initial parameters for eligibility and began the process of partnership with Pionero Philanthropy. However, for various reasons, the nonprofit was not able to meet the parameters for partnership and/or complete the evaluation vetting process. The nonprofit is eligible to request reentry into the partnership process under certain conditions.

- Eligible for Partnership: A nonprofit organization that is ‘Eligible’ for partnership has yet to begin the partnership process with Pionero Philanthropy but meets the initial basic parameters for partnership. 

- Non-Eligible for Partnership: A nonprofit organization that is ‘Non-Eligible’ for partnership does not meet the basic initial parameters and is, therefore, not eligible for partnership with Pionero Philanthropy.
