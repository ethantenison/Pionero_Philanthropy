## **Partner Status** <br />
Pionero Philanthropy categorizes nonprofit organizations in the Republic of Guatemala by Partnership Status. It is our goal to form… <

- **Partner**: A ‘Partner’ is a nonprofit organization that has met the basic initial parameters for eligibility, has met the parameters for partnership, has gone through the evaluation of Pionero, and has been vetted as a noteworthy organization in the Republic of Guatemala based on Pionero’s 5 Pillars: Efficiency, Transparency, Impact, Relevance, and Sustainability. 

- **Discontinued Partner**: A ‘Discontinued Partner’ is a nonprofit organization that met the basic initial parameters for eligibility and began the process of partnership with Pionero Philanthropy. However, for various reasons, the nonprofit was not able to meet the parameters for partnership and/or complete the evaluation vetting process. The nonprofit is eligible to request reentry into the partnership process under certain conditions.

- **Eligible for Partnership**: A nonprofit organization that is ‘Eligible’ for partnership has yet to begin the partnership process with Pionero Philanthropy but meets the initial basic parameters for partnership. 

- **Non-Eligible for Partnership**: A nonprofit organization that is ‘Non-Eligible’ for partnership does not meet the basic initial parameters and is, therefore, not eligible for partnership with Pionero Philanthropy. 


## **Annual Budget**<br />
The Annual Budget acts a nonprofit financial guide reflecting an organization’s plan to spend money over a 12-month period. Annual budgets are presented in US dollars. 


## **Years Active** <br />
Years Active is the lifespan, or age, of the nonprofit based off the number of years since legal foundation in either the United States or in the Republic of Guatemala. This doesn’t include years active through a fiscal sponsor. 

## **Nonprofit Size**<br />
Improving upon pre-established definitions of nonprofit size by the United States Internal Revenue Service, Pionero Philanthropy has created a nonprofit size scale that provides more visibility to low budget organizations in the Guatemalan nonprofit sector. 
<br />

- **Nano**: Annual budget under $50K USD (Target partner distribution- 30% of total PP partners)
- **Micro**: Annual budget between $50K-$100K USD (Target partner distribution- 25% of total PP partners)
- **Small**: Annual budget between $100K-$500K USD (Target partner distribution- 20% of total PP partners)
- **Medium**: Annual budget between $500K-$1M USD (Target partner distribution- 15% of total PP partners)
- **Large**: Annual budget between $1M-2M USD (Target partner distribution- 10% of total PP partners)
- **Very Large**: Annual budget above $2M USD (Target partner distribution- 0% of total PP partners, Non-eligible for partnership)

<br />


## **Faith-Based** <br />
Faith-based organizations are organizations that mention a specific religion, or God, within their  missions, visions, or values.
